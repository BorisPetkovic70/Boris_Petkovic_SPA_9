And now came Fra Domenico from the sacristy in the white chasuble that the Church ordains for the Corpus Christi feast, followed by a page in a clerkly gown of black, and the Mass commenced. \n",

Valentina, little recking now whether the castle held or fell, and still less such trifles as Gonzaga's attendance at Mass, had assented without heeding the import of what he said. \n",
       "\n",
       "And so, his face drawn and his body quivering with the excitement of what he was about to do, Gonzaga had repaired to the ramparts so soon as he had seen them all safely into chapel. The sentinel was that same clerkly youth Aventano, who had read to the soldiers that letter Gian Maria had sent Gonzaga. This the courtier accepted as a good omen. If a man there was among the soldiery at Roccaleone with whom he deemed that he had an account to settle, that man was Aventano.

      "Arrays These are one of the most basic data structures, and they consist of a collection of items that are stored in a contiguous block of memory. Arrays are used to store data of the same type, and they are accessed using an index. Arrays are a very efficient data structure for storing and accessing data, and they are commonly used in many algorithms.   Linked List Linked lists are another common data structure, and they consist of a series of nodes that are connected together by links. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. Linked lists are often used when the size of the data is not known in advance or when the data needs to be inserted or deleted in the middle of the list.  Stacks and Queues Stacks and queues are data structures that are based on the concept of Last In, First Out (LIFO) and First In, First Out (FIFO), respectively. In a stack, items are added to and removed from the top of the stack, while in a queue, items are added to the back and removed from the front. Stacks and queues are commonly used in algorithms for storing and organizing data.   Trees Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of a root node and zero or more child nodes. Each child node can have its own child nodes, creating a tree-like structure. Trees are often used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as the structure of a file system.   Graphs Graphs are another common data structure that consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) and edges that connect them. Graphs are used to represent relationships between entities, and they are commonly used in algorithms for tasks such as network analysis and route planning.\n",
