And now came Fra Domenico from the sacristy in the white chasuble that the Church ordains for the Corpus Christi feast, followed by a page in a clerkly gown of black, and the Mass commenced. \n",

Valentina, little recking now whether the castle held or fell, and still less such trifles as Gonzaga's attendance at Mass, had assented without heeding the import of what he said. \n",

The sentinel was that same clerkly youth Aventano, who had read to the soldiers that letter Gian Maria had sent Gonzaga. This the courtier accepted as a good omen.

      "Dr. Dimitrije D. Chvokić is an associate professor at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (FNSM) at the University of Banja Luka. Previously, he worked as a teaching associate (assistant and senior assistant) at the same university from 2010 to 2021. In his role as an associate, he conducted exercises primarily in computer science subjects. At his initiative, syllabi of subjects such as Chemical Informatics (SP Chemistry), Fundamentals of Informatics (SP Chemistry), Computer Applications in Biology (SP Biology), and Operating Systems (SP TViI) underwent changes during his collaboration.  According to available data, he holds a record for the number of subjects (assignments) and weekly workload at the University of Banja Luka. His areas of interest include optimization at two levels, mathematical modeling of strategic decision-making, prediction of dynamic changes, and ledger technologies (blockchain). Additional information is available on the Biography page. Besides that, there is an official page on the website of the Department of Mathematics and Informatics at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, University of Banja Luka, which, for various known and unknown reasons, is not regularly updated.\n",
